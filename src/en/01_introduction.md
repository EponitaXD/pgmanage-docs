# Introduction

![PgManage application](./images/intro.png)

PgManage is a modern Open-Source Database Client application. This application provides an easy to use environment for querying and administration of multiple DBMS distributions – such as PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, MariaSQL, MariaDB, and Oracle.

Though now dormant, the [OmniDB](https://github.com/OmniDB/OmniDB) project provided important underlying work for the expansions done on PgManage. OmniDB was a light-weight, browser-based application that supported PostgreSQL, Oracle and MySQL. PgManage continues OmniDB’s legacy by providing a simple, unified interface to manage DBMS.

PgManage’s interface allows to quickly switch between multiple Database Sessions through the use of connections sidebar.  
The application allows to run and analyze queries, monitor databases, manage Postgres server configuration, among other features. Though the project is currently focused on the database management, features for developers are being planned as the project progresses.
