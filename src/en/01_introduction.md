# Introduction

![Main page of the MgManage application](./images/intro.png)

PgManage is an application to access and control database management systems (DBMS). This application provides a workspace for managing connections from different SQL distributions – such as PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, MariaSQL, MariaDB, and Oracle.

Though now dormant, the [OmniDB](https://github.com/OmniDB/OmniDB) project provided important underlying work for the expansions done on PgManage. OmniDB was a light-weight, browser-based application that supported connections to PostgreSQL, Oracle and MySQL. PgManage continues OmniDB’s legacy by providing a simple, unified interface to manage DBMS.

PgManage’s interface allows to quickly switch between DBMS through the use of connections without the requirement of different tools. The application allows to run queries, monitor databases, manage server configurations, among other features. Though the project is currently focused on the management DBMS, features for developers are being planned as the project progresses.
